# Tea-Time
Simple watchOS 2.0 tea timer app

I've had an alias in my `.profile` for years that looks like this:

```
teatime='sleep 240; say -v Moira '\''Tea is done'\'
```

Today, I decided to fire up a pot of Harney & Sons Stanley's Blend tea for the first time in _forever_.  I went to my Terminal window to run my `teatime` alias and realized... I should see if I can write a Watch app for that!

So here it is, a very simple Tea Timer app.  Works here.  Let me know if you have any problems with it.
